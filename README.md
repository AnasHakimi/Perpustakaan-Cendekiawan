# Photostat & Printing Service System for Perpustakaan-Cendekiawan UITM Kuala Terengganu

Project Overview: During my internship at the Library of UiTM Kuala Terengganu in my Diploma, I worked on a project to improve the Photostat & Printing Service System. The goal was to streamline the process of account creation and balance top-ups for students, reducing queues at the service counter and ensuring uninterrupted use of printing services.

To address this, I developed a web-based system that allows students to open accounts and add funds online, minimizing the need for physical visits to the counter. This system also helps library staff efficiently manage student accounts, reducing their workload and improving service operations.

Technologies Used: 

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

Backend: PHP 

Database: MySQL 

Development Tools: Visual Studio Code, phpMyAdmin

Key Features and Achievements

✅ Online Account Registration & Top-up: Enabled students to register and add balance online, reducing wait times.

✅ User Authentication & Account Management: Implemented a secure login system for students and staff to manage accounts.

✅ Transaction History Tracking: Allowed users to view past top-ups and printing usage for better financial tracking.

✅ Admin Dashboard for Staff: Developed a backend for library staff to oversee accounts, transactions, and system reports.

✅ Integration with Printing Services: Ensured smooth balance deductions when students use the printing service.

This project enhanced my web development skills, strengthened my database management expertise, and provided hands-on experience in building efficient digital solutions to improve operational workflows. Through this, I gained valuable insights into user experience design, system security, and backend development.
